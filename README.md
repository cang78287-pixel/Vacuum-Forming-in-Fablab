# Vacuum-Forming-in-Fablab
For the group project of "Just a Group", in the Fablab scenario, we upgraded the material system and core technologies of the vacuum forming process. By adopting bioplastics and vacuum bag molding technology, we achieved the greening and substitutability upgrading of the process.
