# Vacuum-Forming-in-Fablab

For the group project of "Just a Group", in the Fablab scenario, we upgraded the material system and core technologies of the vacuum forming process. By adopting bioplastics and vacuum bag molding technology, we achieved the greening and substitutability upgrading of the process.
## 真空成型工艺生物塑料与技术改造项目描述
## Project Description: Modification of Vacuum Forming Process with Bioplastic in Fablab
传统真空成型工艺依赖热塑性塑料片材，存在材料回收难度大、环境负担重等问题；同时，常规抽真空装置在操作灵活性上也难以完全满足Fablab的探索。基于此，我们团队在Fablab场景中，针对真空成型工艺的材料体系与核心技术进行改造，采用生物塑料和真空袋成型技术，实现了工艺的绿色化与可替代性升级。

The traditional vacuum forming process relies on thermoplastic sheets, which pose problems such as high material recycling difficulty and heavy environmental burden. Meanwhile, conventional vacuum extraction devices are also insufficient in operational flexibility to fully meet the exploration needs of Fablabs. Based on this, our team has modified the material system and core technology of the vacuum forming process in the Fablab scenario, adopting bioplastic and vacuum bagging technology to achieve an environmentally friendly and alternative upgrade of the process.
